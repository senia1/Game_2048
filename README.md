# Game_2048

This project is the implementation of the famous game 2048.
  It was carried out by me as part of the course "Creating —Å# window applications" on the Stepik platform.

I have performed the following tasks:

Task 1
Add a menu with the ability to restart, exit the game and view the rules of the game

Task 2
Generate 2 and 4 randomly. 2 spawns with a 75% chance and 4 spawns with a 25% chance.

Task 3
Add the ability to display the best result. This result persists even after restarting the application. And also add the ability to show the history of the game: the user - the number of points scored.

Task 4
Add the ability to select the size of the field

Task 5
Make the color of the cell depend on the value: the larger the value, the darker the color.
